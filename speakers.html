              <h5>What Designers Can Learn from Parenting</h5>
  
              <p>That first client meeting may not feel as warm and fulfilling as the first time you hold your newborn child, but consider the similarities.</p>
  
              <p>You know each other but have never met. As the relationship grows you will have to rely on your experiences and education to gently guide them while allowing flexibility for projects to change and evolve. It&#8217;s not your job to control everything, but if you are successful you will create a well-rounded piece that everyone involved can love.</p>
  
              <h5>About Jennifer</h5>
  
              <p>Jennifer Jones is an event coordinator for the WebVisions Conference and also co-authors a blog with her teenage daughter. She and her family live in Portland, Oregon where she balances work, parenting and any other life challenge with honesty, humor and liquor.</p>

              <h5>Crafty Coding: Generating Knitting Patterns</h5>
  
              <p>Garment design doesn&#8217;t have to be intimidating. Learn the math behind knitting a sweater and program a fully customizable pattern generator in NodeJS. You will leave with your own unique pattern app to share with the world! Basic programming and knitting skills are recommended for this workshop.</p>
  
              <h5>About Tessa</h5>
  
              <p>Tessa Harmon is a full-stack web developer at <a href="http://www.skookum.com/">Skookum Digital Works</a> in Charlotte, North Carolina.

              <h5>From Muppets to Mastery: Core UX Principles from Mr. Jim Henson</h5>
  
              <p>Jim Henson started working as a puppeteer in 1954, a fair 40-50 years before many of us even considered User Experience as a career. He did, however, take it upon himself to apply many of the core principles that UX Designers are falling love with today (or are at least using as part of our everyday lives). Hang out for a quick dive into the life of Jim Henson, with a view into his work from the perspective of how it pertains to what it is we&#8217;re doing today, that promises to even leave Waldorf and Statler happy.</p>
  
              <h5>About Russ</h5>
  
              <p>Russ Unger is an Experience Design Director for GE Capital, Americas, where he leads teams and projects in design and research. He is co-author of the books <cite><a href="http://projectuxd.com/">A Project Guide to UX Design</a></cite>, <cite><a href="http://www.designingtheconversation.com/">Designing the Conversation</a></cite>, and <cite><a href="http://speakercampbook.com/">Speaker Camp</a></cite> for New Riders (Voices That Matter). Russ is also working on a book on guerrilla design and research methods that is due out, well, sometime.</p>
  
              <p>Russ is co-founder of ChicagoCamps, which hosts low-cost, high-value technology events in the Chicago area, and he is also on the Advisory Board for the Department of Web Design and Development at Harrington College of Design.

              <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>
  
              <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217;s the filmmaker&#8217;s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217;ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>
  
              <p>With this workshop, we&#8217;ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217;ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We&#8217;ll consider why they&#8217;re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>
  
              <h5>About Adam</h5>
  
              <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He believes that no matter how utilitarian a tool is, at the core of its creation lies a story; uncovering that story is key to its success. Occasionally, he shares his perspectives on design at <a href="http://adamconnor.com/">adamconnor.com</a> and <a href="http://www.discussingdesign.com/">discussingdesign.com</a>.</p>
